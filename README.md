# This repository holds all the submissions and class codes and hopefully the code for a very good ML project, soon!!
The first class was an intro to python, tho technically it was class 2 as class 1 Wi-Fi wasn't available!! So the first class we spoke about streaming services and how data plays a very important role even if we dont have great UI!
In class 2, we discussed all the basics of python, starting with a simple hello world, if-else conditions, looping conditions, all different data types(Numeric: int,float etc, Sequence:Lists,Tuples etc, Mapping type: Sets,Dictionary etc).
And we solved two questions, which use all the data types stated above(Ana and her meta world and Finding the frequency of the numbers).
Thats it for class 1 and class 2.
